# CDS_Decision_Statements_Loops_CPP

In this experiment, I focused on the for loop in C++. I learned how to use it to execute a block of code repeatedly with a clear initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in a single statement. Practicing for loops helped me understand how to control iteration precisely, making my code more concise and efficient when dealing with repetitive tasks.
